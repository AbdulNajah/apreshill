# About me

I am a Data Scientist & Professional Educator at [RStudio](https://rstudio.com). We develop free and open source tools to make it easier and more fun to do data science with the statistical programming language R. 

I received my Ph.D. in psychology with a concentration in quantitative methods from Vanderbilt University (2008). Previously, I was an Associate Professor at Oregon Health & Science University, where my research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, and Autism Speaks. I have written numerous scientific journal articles and book chapters on autism and neurodevelopmental disorders. I have developed and delivered workshops, graduate-level data science courses, and curricula based on teaching R and the tidyverse.

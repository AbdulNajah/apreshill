# About me

I am an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at <a href = "https://www.ohsu.edu">Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)</a> in Portland, Oregon, and the Assistant Director of OHSU's <a href = "https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/center-for-spoken-language-understanding/" target = "_blank">Center for Spoken Language Understanding</a>, home to the Computer Science graduate education program. I earned my doctorate in developmental psychology, with a concentration in quantitative methods. My current research aims to evaluate whether Natural Language Processing methods can be translated into meaningful outcome measures for individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders like Autism, Down Syndrome, and Fragile X Syndrome. This research is driven by the need for good outcome measures to evaluate the impact of new treatments and interventions for improving language and social functioning. My work has been published in numerous peer-reviewed journals and book chapters, and has been funded by the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on Women’s Health, and the National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders. 

In addition to research, I teach four graduate-level courses using R, and I am the author of *“Working with Data in the Tidyverse,”* to be offered by DataCamp.com. I am also a co-author of the book *“blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown”* with Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas. Finally, I have developed and led several R workshops and smaller team-based training sessions, and love to train new "useRs".

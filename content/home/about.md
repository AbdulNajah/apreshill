# About me

I am a professor of pediatrics in the <a href = "https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/center-for-spoken-language-understanding/" target = "_blank">Center for Spoken Language Understanding</a> at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland, Oregon. I focus on developing more sensitive tools to capture subtle yet meaningful clinical changes in children's language and social functioning. For example, my current research aims to address a real shortcoming in the field of autism and neurodevelopmental disorders - the lack of good outcome measures to evaluate the impact of new treatments and interventions - by creating new ways. 

In addition to research, I teach graduate-level courses at OHSU on statistics, data science, and data visualization using R. I also have developed and led several R workshops, and love to train new "useRs".

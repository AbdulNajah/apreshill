# About me

I am an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at <a href = "https://www.ohsu.edu">Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)</a> in Portland, Oregon, and the Assistant Director of OHSU's <a href = "https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/center-for-spoken-language-understanding/" target = "_blank">Center for Spoken Language Understanding</a>, home to the Computer Science graduate education program. I study health-related applications of Natural Language Processing-based methods, with a focus on pediatric populations with developmental disabilities like Autism Spectrum Disorders, which I've studied for the past 15 years.

In addition to research, I am an experienced educator, with peer- and student-nominated awards for teaching. I teach graduate-level data science courses on Statistics and Data Visualization using the statistical programming language R, and I am the author of *“Working with Data in the Tidyverse,”* to be offered by DataCamp.com.

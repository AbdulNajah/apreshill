I published my [first blog post](../post/up-and-running-with-blogdown) on my [personal website](https://alison.rbind.io/) in June 2017. In it, I shared my carefully curated notes documenting my personal adventure trying to create my new site using blogdown, even before the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) was written. I originally made those notes to myself while on my maternity leave. I had very few and very short nap/pump breaks to work with, and found myself in the awkward position of having created approximately 5 websites in 1 week, each of which taught me something new and important but by week 2, I was making the same mistakes as I had in week 1! So I started writing _everything_ down.

After finally getting my first site up and running, I was determined to share my notes in my first blog post. I made it my "pumping project", and polished it up over a few weeks. Finally, it was ready, and for the first time I published a blog post on my site. I remember holding my breath with that push to GitHub-- but onward! A lot of blood/sweat/tears/breast milk had gone into this. I linked to the post in the [rbind/support Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/rbind/support), and minutes later the author of the blogdown package, [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/), responded:

After that, I joined [Yihui](https://yihui.name/) and [Amber Thomas](https://amber.rbind.io/) as a co-author on the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), which was published in December of that same year.

I'm so proud to have contributed to this book, and will always be grateful to Yihui for the opportunity. It was published by [Chapman & Hall/CRC](https://www.crcpress.com/p/book/9780815363729).

So that one blog post, published on my own [personal website](https://alison.rbind.io/), set in motion a lot of changes for me. In hindsight, it was the catalyst for my own recent career change to Data Scientist & Professional Educator at RStudio. If I have one piece of advice for you, dear reader, it is that if you have gotten this far, don't turn back- you are already pretty far! :smile: It is worth the journey.

But as with most things in R that take time and effort, information decays, gets out of date, and needs a little :blue_heart:. So that is what this tutorial is: an updated (but not brief!) guide to getting up and running with blogdown, GitHub, and Netlify. I am leaving my original [blog post](../post/up-and-running-with-blogdown) up with a disclaimer that some of the information is out-of-date. If you are reading this in 2018 or later, then you are where you should be! [Read on](01_blogdown-resources)...

I published my [first blog post](../post/up-and-running-with-blogdown) on my [personal website](https://alison.rbind.io/) in June 2017. In it, I shared my carefully curated notes documenting my personal adventure trying to create my new site using blogdown, before the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) was finished.

After publishing that post, I shared it in the [rbind/support Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/rbind/support) in the hopes of at least getting feedback for improving it, and with the highest hope that it would be useful to at least one human being other than myself. Minutes later, the author of the blogdown package, [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/), responded:

After that, I joined [Yihui](https://yihui.name/) and [Amber Thomas](https://amber.rbind.io/) as a co-author on the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), which was published in December of that same year.

I'm so proud to have contributed to this book, and will always be grateful to Yihui for the opportunity. The book was published by [Chapman & Hall/CRC](https://www.crcpress.com/p/book/9780815363729), and the online version of this book is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). It is and always will be available [online](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for free.

Since then, I have joined [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as a Data Scientist & Professional Educator, and I have taught blogdown to so many more R users, including the [Advanced R Markdown workshop](https://arm.rbind.io/) at rstudio::conf 2019. I appreciate every learner I have had the privilege to work with- they have all given me unique insights into what is hard about using blogdown *and* what is hard about teaching blogdown :blue_heart:. 

So that is what this tutorial is: an updated (but not brief!) guide to getting a site up and running with blogdown, GitHub, and Netlify. There are many ways to build and publish a website, and even a blogdown website, but after over two years of using and teaching blogdown, this set of tools and workflow is the one I'm most comfortable recommending to the widest range of R users, and the one that I personally use.

I am leaving my original [blog post](../post/up-and-running-with-blogdown) up with a disclaimer that some of the information is out-of-date. If you are reading this in 2018 or later, then you are where you should be! [Read on](01_blogdown-resources)...

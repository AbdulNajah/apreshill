Before you start, I recommend at least opening the following tabs for reference as you work:

* [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill :tada:
* [The blogdown demo site](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/)

I also found this comment by Eric Nantz, the creator of [the R-Podcast](http://r-podcast.org), in the [rbind/support issues section on GitHub](https://github.com/rbind/support) to be helpful:

* [https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/12](https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/12)

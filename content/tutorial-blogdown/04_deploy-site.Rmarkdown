Deploying with Netlify through GitHub is smooth. I realize that at this point you are looking at a cookie cutter example website, but let's go ahead and get the pipeline to publishing working **now** and [automate both building and deploying using Netlify](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html#netlify). This way, you'll be confident that all this work will result in an actually published and shareable site- and hopefully you'll be more motivated to work on customizing the content!

1. Commit all changes and push to GitHub, then go online to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). 
2. Click on the **Sign Up** button and sign up using your existing GitHub account (no need to create another account)
3. Log in, and select: `New site from Git -> Continuous Deployment: GitHub`.
4. From there, Netlify will allow you to select from your existing GitHub repositories. You'll pick the repo you've been working from with `blogdown`, then you'll configure your build. This involves specifying two important things: the build command and the publish directory (this should be `public`).

    * More about the build command from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#common-configuration-directives): *"For Hugo hosting, `hugo` will build and deploy with the version 0.17 of `hugo`. You can specify a specific `hugo` release like this: `hugo_0.15`. Currently `0.13`, `0.14`, `0.15`, `0.16`, `0.17`, `0.18` and `0.19` are supported. For version `0.20` and above, youâ€™ll need to create a Build environment variable called `HUGO_VERSION` and set it to the version of your choice."* I opted for the former, and specified `hugo_0.19`. 
    
Using the blogdown R package, uou can check your `hugo` version and update if needed. You'll want to make sure that Netlify is using the same version of Hugo that you are running locally.

```{r}
blogdown::hugo_version() # to check your version
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
blogdown::update_hugo() # to force an update
```

Netlify will deploy your site and assign you a random subdomain name of the form `random-word-12345.netlify.com`. Mine was particularly unfortunate, with the random word `garbage-collector-janice`. You should know that you can change this; I changed mine to `apreshill.netlify.com`. 


{{% alert note %}}
Anytime you change your subdomain name, you need to update the `baseurl` in your `config.toml` file (so I changed mine to baseurl = "https://apreshill.netlify.com/").

At this point, you should be up and running with `blogdown`, GitHub, and Netlify, but here are some ideas if you want to go further...

### Check Hugo version {#hugoversion}

Many problems arise from having an outdated version of Hugo.

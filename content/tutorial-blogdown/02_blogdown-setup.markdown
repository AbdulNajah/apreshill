## Install R and RStudio {#system}

* The [latest version of R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (3.5.1 "Feather Spray") is recommended but not required.
  * Scared to update? Read [these instructions](https://whattheyforgot.org/maintaining-r.html#how-to-transfer-your-library-when-updating-r).
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) (>= 1.2)
  * I recommend downloading the [preview version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/) so you can have the option to show [hidden files like .gitignore](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/1769)

## Get comfortable {#comfort}

For this tutorial, we'll assume familiarity with:

* Using the terminal (I use the [terminal within RStudio](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/08/11/rstudio-v1-1-preview-terminal/))
* R
* Using the RStudio IDE
* Git and GitHub

If you are not comfortable with all of these, here are some places to get started:

* For Git/GitHub: [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan et al.
* For RStudio: [DataCamp's Working with the RStudio IDE (free)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1) by Garrett Grolemund
* For Terminal: 
  * [The Command Line Murder Mystery](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery) by Noah Veltman, and 
  * [The UNIX Workbench](http://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/) by Sean Kross

I also have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed- [you will probably need these to download Hugo on a Mac](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/installation.html). If you don't have either but are on a Mac, this link may help:

* [How to install Xcode, Homebrew, Git, RVM, Ruby & Rails on Mac OS X ](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/)

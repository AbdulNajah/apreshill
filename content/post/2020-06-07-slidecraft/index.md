have a theme

It can be simple, but it will help unite otherwise disjointed visuals.

If you are working with real data, maybe something inspired by that.


I think visuals like image and gifs *can* detract when not united. If you get lucky, your theme can also help you reinforce a key concept or analogy you want to leverage.

Some of my themes:

Superhero- I found this great gif of helping your students

Birds (tidymodels)- this idea came to me after a video call with Andreas mueller where he talked about a “model in hand”

Hot air balloon for sharing on short notice. I really needed a visual that would help us guide listeners from a single Rmd to multiple Rmds, and I wanted one where annotations could be incremented. This one I was really happy with because I was able to use all vintage/retro illustrations, which I think created a fun vibe.

Beatles, sad plot better. This one I came up with the title first, and all of the rest followed from there.

It IS ok to not have a theme, and instead just have pretty colors/fonts

What broke me into making Rmd-based slides was teaching data visualization. I simply could not

## make font bigger. Make a few slides, then make font yet bigger, and cut the fat

# increment, don’t animate

For this I go to powerpoint or keynote. I actually strongly prefer powerpoint as a way to make graphics that I then:

- export to png/jpg
- read in as full bleed images in xaringan

This is the worst part of an Rmd-based workflow for slides. But there is always an inherent trade off between ease of showing code/output and ease of image creation.

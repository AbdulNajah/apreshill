# Read up on blogdown

Before you start, I recommend reading the following:

* [`blogdown`: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas
* [Making a Website Using `blogdown`, Hugo, and GitHub pages](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/) also by Amber Thomas
* [Getting Started with `blogdown`](https://www.znmeb.mobi/2017/05/12/getting-started-with-blogdown/) by M. Edward (Ed) Borasky

I also found this comment by Eric Nantz, the creator of [the R-Podcast](http://r-podcast.org), in the [`rbind/support` issues section on Github](https://github.com/rbind/support) to be helpful:

* [https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/12](https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/12)


# Caveats, disclaimers, etc.

Even with all the great resources I listed above, getting myself up and running took a few tries, so in this post I'm passing along what ended up working for me. Everyone's mileage may vary, though, depending on your operating system and your approach. About me: I am a macOS user, and I use R, RStudio, Git (usually via [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com), sometimes via [GitHub](https://github.com)), and terminal regularly, so I'm assuming familiarity here with all of these. If that is not you, here are some places to get started:

* For Git: [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com) by Jenny Bryan et al.
* For RStudio: [DataCamp's Working with the RStudio IDE (free)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1) by Garrett Grolemund
* For Terminal: [The Command Line Murder Mystery](https://github.com/veltman/clmystery) by Noah Veltman

I also have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed- [you will probably need these to download Hugo](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/installation.html). If you don't have either but are on a mac, this link may help:

* [How to install Xcode, Homebrew, Git, RVM, Ruby & Rails on Mac OS X ](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/)

Finally, I did not want to learn more about a lot of things! For instance, the nitty gritty of static site generators and how domain names work. I have a 4-month-old baby so it seemed safest to wait to learn more things until I am getting REM sleep again, so maybe in 2 or 3 years I will be more ambitious! Just in the process of writing all this up, I filled up my tea mug twice with ice cold water, and filled my water bottle with scalding hot water. So, if Yihui and Amber gave some advice, I took it and moved on. For example:

* ["Considering the cost and friendliness to beginners, we currently recommend Netlify."](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html) Sold. 
* ["If you are not familiar with domain names or do not want to learn more about them, an option for your consideration is a free subdomain `*.rbind.io` offered by RStudio, Inc."](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html). Done. 



# In GitHub

![](/img/posts/2017-05-17-up-and-running-with-blogdown/blogdown-signpost-1.png)


1. Go online to your [GitHub](https://github.com) account, and create a new repository (check to initialize with a `README` but don't add `.gitignore`- this will be taken care of later). For naming your repo, consider your future deployment plan:

    * If you are going to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host the site, rather than [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), you can name this repository anything you want! You can see some of the repo names used by members of the `rbind` organization [here](https://github.com/rbind/repositories). I called mine `apreshill` since that is also by [GitHub username](https://github.com/apreshill) and my [twitter handle](https://twitter.com/apreshill).
    * If you want to host your site as a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com), you should name your repository `yourgithubusername.github.io` (so mine would have been `apreshill.github.io`). If you are going this route, I suggest you follow [Amber's instructions](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/) instead of mine!

![Screenshot above: Creating a new repository in GitHub](/img/posts/2017-05-17-up-and-running-with-blogdown/github-new-repo.png)

2. Go to the main page of your new repository, and under the repository name, click the green **Clone or download** button.

3. In the **Clone with HTTPs** section, click on the clipboard icon to copy the clone URL for your new repository. You'll paste this text into terminal in the next section.
    
# In terminal

![](/img/posts/2017-05-17-up-and-running-with-blogdown/blogdown-signpost-2.png)

Now you will [clone your remote repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) and create a local copy on your computer so you can sync between the two locations (using terminal or your alternative command line tool for a Windows machine).
    
1. Use `cd` to navigate into the directory where you want your repo to be

2. Once there, type: `git clone [paste]`. So my command looked like this:

```{r}
git clone https://github.com/apreshill/apreshill.git
```

And this is what printed to my terminal window:

```{r}
Cloning into 'apreshill'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

3. Close terminal, you are done in there.

# In RStudio 

![](/img/posts/2017-05-17-up-and-running-with-blogdown/blogdown-signpost-3.png)

Now you need to download Hugo, and you should use `blogdown`'s helper function to install it via R, so you'll first install the `blogdown` package.


1. Install `blogdown` from your RStudio console. If you already have `devtools` installed like I did, you can just use the second line below:

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
```

2. Still in the RStudio console, load the `blogdown` package to run the `install_hugo` function:

```{r}
blogdown::install_hugo()
# or
library(blogdown)
install_hugo()
```


{{% alert note %}}
This is where my instructions diverge from Ed's- he states that `blogdown` won't create a website in your root folder because the `README.md` file is already there. I didn't find that to be the case- I tested this with a new site as well. If one way doesn't work for you, try the other!
{{% /alert %}}




3. Use the top menu buttons in RStudio to select `File -> New Project -> Existing Directory`, then browse to the directory on your computer where your GitHub repo is and click on the **Create Project** button.

![Screenshot above: Creating a new project in an existing directory in RStudio](/img/posts/2017-05-17-up-and-running-with-blogdown/r-project-existing-directory.png)

4. Now you should be "in" your project in RStudio. If you are using git for version control, edit your `*gitignore` file. This file should be viewable in your file viewer pane in RStudio. Below is what it should look like: the first four lines will automatically be in this file if you have set up your RStudio Project, but if you plan to use Netlify to deploy, you need to add the `public/` line ([read about here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/version-control.html).)

```{r}
.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
blogdown
.DS_Store # if a windows user, Thumbs.db instead
public/ # if using Netlify
```



# Build your site in RStudio

![](/img/posts/2017-05-17-up-and-running-with-blogdown/blogdown-signpost-4.png)

Now you can finally build your site using the `blogdown::new_site()` function. But **first** you should at least think about themes...

## Picking a theme

I looked at so many [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io) my eyes were crossing. So I went back to the `blogdown` book. Thankfully, Yihui and Amber offer ["to save you some time, we list a few themes below that match our taste..."](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html). Huzzah- I went with [hugo-academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic)! Whatever theme you choose, you'll need to pick one of 3 ways to make your new site:

1. If you are happy with the default theme, which is the lithium theme, you can use: 

```{r}
blogdown::new_site() # default theme is lithium
```

2. If you want a theme other than the default, you can specify the theme at the same time as you call the `new_site` function:

```{r}
# for example, create a new site with the academic theme
blogdown::new_site(theme = "gcushen/hugo-academic", theme_example = TRUE)
```

3. If instead you want to add the theme later (like I did, because I didn't see the above example until it was too late!), you can do this:
    
```{r}
library(blogdown)
new_site() # default theme is lithium
# need to stop serving so can use the console again
install_theme("gcushen/hugo-academic", theme_example = TRUE, update_config = TRUE)
```

{{% alert note %}}
Now is a good time to re-read about `blogdown::serve_site()` and [how _LiveReload_ works](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/a-quick-example.html) (and how it blocks your R console by default)
{{% /alert %}}

I recommend setting `theme_example = TRUE`- some themes won't provide an example site, but the academic theme did and I found it helpful to see. You can always delete the example content.

{{% alert warning %}}
If your example site is not loading correctly in your RStudio viewer pane, I have found that several themes replace the `baseurl` in the `config.toml` file with something like "https://example.com", without the trailing `/`. This is an infuriating but quick fix- see below section on editing configurations.
{{% /alert %}}



## Update project options

In your project in RStudio, go to the top menu bar of RStudio and select `Tools -> Project Options` and update following [Yihui and Amber's instructions](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html#fig:project-options).


## Edit your configurations

Relevant reading:

* [`blogdown` book chapter on configuration](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/configuration.html)
* [Additional detail from Amber](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/#site-configuration)
* You can also view [my `config.toml` file](https://github.com/apreshill/apreshill/blob/master/config.toml)

Now, edit the `baseurl` in your `config.toml` file. The URL *should always* end with a `/` trailing slash. At this point, you probably haven't deployed your site yet, so to view it locally you can use the Addin "Serve Site", or run the `blogdown::serve_site` function. Both of these `baseurl`s worked for me when viewing locally:

```{r}
baseurl = "https://example.com/"
baseurl = "/"
```

{{% alert warning %}}
It is worth saying again- make sure that the `baseurl = ` listed has a `/` at the end!
{{% /alert %}}

Go ahead and edit that `config.toml` file now as you please- this is how you personalize your site!

## Addins & workflow

Relevant reading:

* [`blogdown` book chapter on the RStudio IDE](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html)


Addins: use them. Note that you don't need the `blogdown` package loaded in the console if you use the Addins. My workflow in RStudio at this point (again, just viewing locally because we haven't deployed yet) works best like this:

1. Open the RStudio project for the site
2. Use the add-in to serve the site (only once due to the magic of LiveReload).
3. View site in the RStudio viewer pane, but I also show it in a new browser window and leave it open there while I work.
3. Select existing files to edit using the file pane in RStudio.
4. After making changes, click the save button (don't `knit`!!)- the console will reload, the viewer pane will update, and if you hit refresh in the browser your local view will also be updated.
5. When happy with changes, commit/push changes to GitHub.

Note that the above workflow is only for editing existing files or posts, but not for **creating new posts**. For that, read on...




## Posting

This was surprisingly difficult at first!

Relevant reading:

* [`blogdown` book chapter on RStudio IDE](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html)
* [`blogdown` book chapter on output formats](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html): on .md versus .Rmd posts
* [Additional detail from Amber](https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/#adding-a-blog-post-or-portfolio-piece) on adding a blog post

Bottom line:

Use the Addin for `New Post`. But, you need to stop first before doing so. The Addin is a Shiny interface that runs this code in your console: `blogdown:::new_post_addin()`. So, your console needs to not be blocked for it to run. You also need to be "in" your RStudio project, otherwise it won't work.

### Draft posts

Whether you do a markdown or R Markdown post (see below), you should know that in the YAML front matter of your new file, you can add `draft: TRUE` and you will be able to preview your post using `blogdown::serve_site()`, but conveniently your post will not show up on your deployed site until you set it to false. Obviously, this is a function built into Hugo and all posts (draft or not) will still end up in your GitHub repo, so don't put top secret blog posts in there as enterprising individuals can still find and read them!

Relevant reading:

* [`blogdown` book chapter on building a website for local preview](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/local-preview.html)


### New markdown posts

Pick one of 2 methods:

1. Use the Addin and use the radio button at the bottom to select **Format: Markdown** (recommended)
2. If you want to use the console to author a new plain `.md` post, use the `blogdown::new_post()` function:

```{r}
blogdown::new_post()
blogdown::new_post(rmd = FALSE) # false is the default!
```

Here are the arguments according to `?new_post`:

```{r}
new_post(title, kind = "default", open = interactive(), 
    author = getOption("blogdown.author"), categories = NULL, 
    tags = NULL, date = Sys.Date(), file = NULL, slug = NULL, 
    subdir = getOption("blogdown.subdir", "post"), rmd = getOption("blogdown.rmd", 
        FALSE))
```



### New RMarkdown posts

Again, pick one of 2 methods:

1. Use the Addin and use the radio button at the bottom to select **Format: RMarkdown** (recommended)
2. If you want to use the console to author a new `.Rmd` post, use the `blogdown::new_post()` function:

```{r}
blogdown::new_post(rmd = TRUE) # false is the default!
```


{{% alert warning %}}
The most important thing to remember is to **not** knit your `.Rmd` posts. Use `blogdown::serve_site` first before pushing to Github. The only Netlify deployment failures I ever experienced were because I knitted to html.
{{% /alert %}}



### Adding images to a post

If you want to include an image that is not a figure created from an R chunk, the [recommended method](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/45) is to: 

1. Add the image to your `/static/img/` folder, then 
2. Reference the image using the relative file path as follows:

```{r}
![my-image](/img/my-image.png)
```

# Deploy in Netlify

![](/img/posts/2017-05-17-up-and-running-with-blogdown/blogdown-signpost-5.png)

Deploying in Netlify was surprisingly painless. Yihui and Amber give some [beginner instructions](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html), but Netlify is so easy I recommend that you skip dragging your `public` folder in and instead [automate the process through GitHub](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html#netlify).

1. When you are ready to deploy, commit your changes and push to GitHub, then go online to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). 
2. Click on the **Sign Up** button and sign up using your existing GitHub account (no need to create another account)
3. Log in, and select: `New site from Git -> Continuous Deployment: GitHub`.
4. From there, Netlify will allow you to select from your existing GitHub repositories. You'll pick the repo you've been working from with `blogdown`, then you'll configure your build. This involves specifying two important things: the build command and the publish directory (this should be `public`).

    * More about the build command from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#common-configuration-directives): *"For Hugo hosting, `hugo` will build and deploy with the version 0.17 of `hugo`. You can specify a specific `hugo` release like this: `hugo_0.15`. Currently `0.13`, `0.14`, `0.15`, `0.16`, `0.17`, `0.18` and `0.19` are supported. For version `0.20` and above, you’ll need to create a Build environment variable called `HUGO_VERSION` and set it to the version of your choice."* I opted for the former, and specified `hugo_0.19`. However, you can check your `hugo` version in terminal using the command [`hugo version`](https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/). This is what my output looked like, which means that I could run version `0.20` if I wanted to through Netlify, but I went with `0.19` and it works just fine.

```{r}
$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.20.7 darwin/amd64 BuildDate: 2017-05-08T18:37:40-07:00
```





![Screenshot above: Basic build settings in Netlify](/img/posts/2017-05-17-up-and-running-with-blogdown/netlify-build-settings.png)

Netlify will deploy your site and assign you a random subdomain name of the form `random-word-12345.netlify.com`. Mine was particularly unfortunate, with the random word `garbage-collector-janice`. You should know that you can change this; I changed mine to `apreshill.netlify.com`. Note that anytime you change your subdomain name, you need to update the `baseurl` in your `config.toml` file (so I changed mine to `baseurl = "https://apreshill.netlify.com/"`).


At this point, you should be up and running with `blogdown`, GitHub, and Netlify, but here are some ideas if you want to go further...

# Going further

## Custom CSS

I like to tinker with default theme settings like colors and fonts. Every Hugo theme is structured a little differently, but if you are interested, you can check out [my custom css](https://github.com/apreshill/apreshill/blob/master/static/css/blue.css) to see how I customized the academic theme, which provides a way to link to a custom CSS file in the `config.toml` file:

```{r}
  # Link custom CSS and JS assets
  #   (relative to /static/css and /static/js respectively)
  custom_css = ["blue.css"]
```

## Formspree

I used [Formspree](https://formspree.io) to make a contact form, which is an online service (managed on [GitHub](https://github.com/formspree/formspree)) that allows you to add an HTML form to your static site. It is **really** easy- no registration, just use the form and confirm your email address once. I added the following code into [my contact widget](https://github.com/apreshill/apreshill/blob/master/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/widgets/contact.html):

```{r}
<form action="https://formspree.io/your@email.com" method="POST">
  <label for="name">Your name: </label>
  <input type="text" name="name" required="required" placeholder="here"><br>
  <label for="email">Your email: </label>
  <input type="email" name="_replyto" required="required" placeholder="here"><br>
  <label for="message">Your message:</label><br>
  <textarea rows="4" name="message" id="message" required="required" class="form-control" placeholder="I can't wait to read this!"></textarea>
  <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="/html/thanks.html" />
  <input type="submit" value="Send" name="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-outline">
  <input type="hidden" name="_subject" value="Website message" />
  <input type="text" name="_gotcha" style="display:none" />
</form>
```

I also made a totally silly [thank you page](https://apreshill.rbind.io/html/thanks.html), so use my [formspree](https://apreshill.rbind.io/#contact) to enjoy!


## `*.rbind.io` domain names

You may want a different [domain name](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/domain-name.html) than the one provided by Netlify. I opted for a free subdomain `*.rbind.io` offered by RStudio. To do the same, head over to the [rbind/support GitHub page](https://github.com/rbind/support/issues) and open a new issue. All you need to do is let them know what your Netlify subdomain name is (`*.netlify.com`), and what you want your subdomain name to be (`*.rbind.io`). The [awesome `rbind` support team](https://support.rbind.io) will help you take it from there! Note that again, you will need to update the `baseurl` in your `config.toml` file to reflect your new rbind subdomain name (so mine is `baseurl = "https://apreshill.rbind.io/"`).

## Have fun!

Lastly, have fun playing around. Happy `blogdown`ing!
